## First findings
I looked to the [provided url](http://bit.ly/2iRebHx) for the API endpoint, in order to check the data that is retrieved. I've found the structure not much clear, at least not for me. Then I decided to look the [API documentation](http://bit.ly/2AMlNmS) and finding clear information about it. Including a [cleaner url](http://bit.ly/2BBNp18) which I used for this technical challenge.

## Request parameters
```
$limit -> to get a specific number of items
$offset -> to move thru the dataset -page number alike-
When the offset is reached out, the endpoint response is empty.
```
